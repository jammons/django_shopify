    <h1>Starting a Shopify App</h1>
    <p>The first thing you're going to need to do to get this Django app
    running is to create an app on Shopify. This is fairly simple:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an account on <a href='https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/auth/login'>app.shopify.com</a></li>
        <li>Create an app and enter http://localhost:8000 for the application URL.</li>
        <li>Copy your API Key and Shared Secret into the shopify_settings.py file. (You have to click "show secret" to see it.</li>
    </ol>
    <a href="{% url editing_shopify_settings %}">Next</a>
{% endblock %}
